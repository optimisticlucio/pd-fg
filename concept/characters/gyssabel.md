# GYSSABEL

[insert gameplay plan here]

## Special Abilities

**Illusion:** By holding down the special attack button for a short while, the player can input a series of moves that an illusion will act on. Once released, the player regains control of Gyssabel, and simultaneously the illusion is released. The illusion cannot deal damage.

- We're avoiding recursive illusions by having the input button held down the whole time.
- What to do if a player taps the button by accident? What's default behaviour?
  - A feint? (Looks like the start of the attack but instantly dissipates)
    - Might be confusing for new players. "This button doesn't do fuck!"
    - People barely use feints in other games.
  - An illusion that just runs forward?
    - Would be clear what the move does, might make it less flexible.
