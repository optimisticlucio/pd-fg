# PENNY

We gotta have penny - the most violent of the cast, popular character rn. But what does she play like?

Maybe aggressive with a focus on grabbing; she loves wrestling. Her moves could be very risky but give big reward, making her players as "FUCK IT WE BALL" as she is.

## Special Moves

**Insert WWE Reference Here:** Penny does a running jump and grabs the opponent, slamming him into the floor.

- You can be punched while in the air, so it's risky. But it's a moving grab, which are always good.
- A "fuck it, get over here" move.
