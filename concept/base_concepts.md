# Power Down: The Fighting Game

(TODO: [Come up with a better name than this](/concept/name_ideas.md))

The Power Down Fighting Game (PDFG going forward) is a 1v1 game where each player picks a character from the Power Down cast and beats eachother senseless.

## Broad Concepts

**The game should have entry-level intentional play as a priority.** We should try and limit the situations where players just *press shit* because they have no idea what to do. Obviously some people will always do this but still.

## Mechanical Specifics

**We're going to avoid complex inputs** (any input involving more than a single button press/a direction button and an action button) as much as possible. In most cases they've shown themselves to not really add much to the experience at the upper play level, and in lower play it feels like an arbitrary stopgap limiting you from executing on ideas you already conceptualized.

- Strings of inputs (for example - a punch, that afterwards you can input a second, cooler punch) are fine in moderation: they're annoying to memorize but don't have any issues beyond that.

**The inputs** will be four directions, an attack button, a special attack button, and a jump button.

- I don't want a block button, or to make "blocking" a unique, different state you reach in any way. Honestly it feels like something everyone is copying from SF2 without really thinking about it, because even if people over the years made cool things with that mechanic (crossups), I really wonder how much of the game would really change in its absence.
  - I think blocking will just be the default. Unless you are running at someone, or doing an attack of your own, you are blocking.
  - Do we do high/low attacks?
- We have 3 buttons, but most controllers have 4 inputs. What do we make the last button? Grabbing?
